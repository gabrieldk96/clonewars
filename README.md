I am a 23 year old working in commercial real estate with a finance background.
One day I plan to become a developer in the multifamily, office, and maybe even industrial sectors of the business.
I chose FinTech because I know that with technolgical and business trends, FinTech will be a useful tool in my career path that will help me achieve my goals.
